Define Monolithic architecture
monolithic architecture refers to a software design pattern where all components, services, and modules of an application are combined into a single unit or codebase. The application is built, tested, and deployed as a whole. This architecture has some advantages, such as simplicity and ease of development, but it can become difficult to scale and maintain as the application grows in complexity.

• Explain microservices in your own understanding
In my understanding, microservices are a software architecture pattern where an application is broken down into small, loosely coupled, and independently deployable components, each responsible for a specific functionality. These components, or microservices, communicate with each other using APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) and can be developed, tested, and deployed independently. This approach offers benefits such as improved scalability, flexibility, and easier maintenance.

• Which of the backend architecture appeals to you and why?

 Microservices architecture often appeals to those who prioritize scalability, flexibility, and ease of maintenance

• Is Nodejs a multithreaded language?


• What does REPL stand for?
REPL stands for Read-Eval-Print Loop# Node-getting-started
